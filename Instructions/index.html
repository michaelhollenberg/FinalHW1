			<p> My name is Michael Hollenberg. This is a picture from a poker tournament I won for $130,000. When I was in college I played poker profesionally. I traveled the country playing tournaments and even appeared on some televised final tables. After college I took a job in the finance industry at Merrill Lynch.  I worked there for about 15 months, and soon decided that wasn't where I wanted to be.  Thus I ended up at Georgia Tech Coding bootcamp to try and learn a new skill and switch career paths.
